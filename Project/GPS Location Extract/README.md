Hello Guys, this is the first video shows on how Arduino with GPS Module Neo 6M works.

I just upload a empty code on arduino just to extract the latitude and longitude information from serial monitor.
The serial monitor will show NMEA sentences where you can copy the GLL sentence and put in the website http://freenmea.net/decoder to get your current longitude and latitude location.
