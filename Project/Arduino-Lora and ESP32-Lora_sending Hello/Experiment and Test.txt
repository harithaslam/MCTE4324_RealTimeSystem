The code above is the first trial using Lora where Arduino is set as the transmitter while ESP32 as the receiver.

Upon testing, I noticed that the Lora sender/transmitter keep sending the package, but the receiver just receive once. // See The Video

Then, during the second test, where I hold the antenna upwards with my hand, I got more result with Lora receiving the hello message thrice but with unwanted message string written. After that, I put down the antenna down and the receiver stop receiving even when I hold back the antenna upwards later on.
