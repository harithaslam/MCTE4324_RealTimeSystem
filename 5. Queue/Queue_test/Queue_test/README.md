INTRODUCTION TO QUEUE

Queue allows us to pass uninterrupted messages between task. It uses the concept of First In First Out (FIFO) where the first task is prioritized, while the other tasks that is being queue within delay time. 

From the video you can see, a queue is full, when a more task is added. Changing the queue length/size will not affect the task waiting faster instead changing the queue to a longer time will allows a longer time for queue to be able to wait before the next is executed
