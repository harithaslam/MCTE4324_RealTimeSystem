//INTRODUCTION TO REAL TIME SYSTEM

//A real-time system is any information processing system which has to respond to externally generated input stimuli within a finite and specified period.
//In other words, slow response may lead to risk severe consequences
//A simple example portrayed: A car might need faster for its airbag to comes out when severe accident happened.

//the correctness depends not only on the logical result 
//but also the time it was delivered failure to respond is as bad as the wrong response!

/*PATTERN OR TYPE OF REAL TIME SYSTEM*/
1. Hard Real Time:
Systems where it is absolutely imperative that responses occur within the required deadline.
E.g. Flight control systems.

2. Soft Real Time:
Systems where deadlines are important but which will still function correctly if deadlines are occasionally missed.
E.g. DAQ(Data acquisition system)

3. Firm Real Time:
Systems which are soft real-time but in which there is no benefit from late delivery of service.
