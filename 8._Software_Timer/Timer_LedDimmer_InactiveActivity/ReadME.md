This is The Challenge Code learned from Digi-Key

In this FreeRTOS code, it implements the idea of implementing the Timer using xTimerCreate function as One-Shot Timer to set 5 seconds for the LED to turn on once there is an activity (printing the character on serial). 

Once, no activity done within 5 seconds, the LED will turn off.
